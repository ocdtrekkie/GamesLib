# GamesLib
The goal of this project is to download the game library information from various game stores so there is a one-stop shop of information about what games you own, and which stores you own them at.

## Status
This project is heavily hampered by the fact that only Steam seems to have a public, properly supported API to access one's game library.

* Steam: IMPLEMENTED
* GOG: Possibly usable: https://gogapidocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
* Google Play: Possibly importable from Google Takeout data
* Humble Bundle: Possibly usable: https://www.schiff.io/projects/humble-bundle-api
* Battle.net App: NEED API
* Discord Store: NEED API
* Epic Games Store: NEED API
* Microsoft Store: NEED API
* Origin: NEED API
* Twitch Store: NEED API
* Uplay Store: NEED API
